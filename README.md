The Pragyan AI Health Command Center is an elite medical intelligence platform utilizing a proprietary Multi-Modal ML Engine to synthesize real-time biosensor streams from BioSentinel wearables into high-precision triage, predictive risk stratification, and autonomous clinical routing across five critical axes.

🚀 Key Innovations & Features
ML-Driven Hybrid Triage Engine: A sophisticated multi-modal architecture that synthesizes high-frequency biosensor data with clinical linguistics for real-time differential diagnosis.

BioSentinel Wearable Integration: Seamless hardware-to-software bridging via an AI-powered wearable that monitors vitals to predict life-threatening conditions like Sepsis.

Dynamic Pentagon Radar Triage: A unique 5-axis visualization mapping risk across Cardiac, Neuro, Vitals, History, and Speech domains.

Vocal Biomarker Analysis: Proprietary ML modules analyzing speech patterns to detect early-stage neurological distress and stroke symptoms.

Real-Time Vitals Synchronization: Custom data pipeline streaming live ECG, Heart Rate, and SpO2 data directly into the AI engine.

Context-Aware EHR Integration: Engine adjusts risk scores by cross-referencing acute symptoms with longitudinal history, such as diabetic status.

Autonomous Routing Protocol: Instantly assigns patients to specialized departments (Cardiology, Neurology, etc.) based on complex ML-detected symptom clusters.

Predictive Crisis Detection: Identifies the onset of hypertensive crises or cardiac events using advanced behavioral analysis models.

Automated Clinical Justification: Generates transparent, "white-box" AI reasoning for every triage decision to assist medical professionals.

Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation: Integrated hardware prototype mimicking physical interactions to validate sensor accuracy under stress.

Zero-Touch Emergency Alerts: Automated high-priority notification system (via SMS/WhatsApp) triggered when risk scores exceed critical thresholds.

Multi-Step Modular Intake: A structured 5-module data acquisition system ensuring comprehensive coverage of patient history and symptoms.
